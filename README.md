This is a basic project written in C++ and designed to allow a user to interact with Turtlesim, and Turtlebot3(Waffle) in Gazebo. 

The project consists of a controller node (for the turtlesim version) and a controller node (for the turtlebot3 version).

Each version of the project can be launched using its own launch file. 

The user can then send goals (e.g. linear speed, angular speed, and duration) via the command line and see the goal carried out either in the Gazebo simulation or turtlesim simulation.
